# Catch-up

Build one dashboard of everything the user has in flight across ALL their
projects, pulled from the per-project memory stores. The user juggles many
projects and needs a single bird's-eye view, not a per-project dig.

## Step 1 — Find all the state files

Across every project's memory folder — `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/` — collect
(Bash/Glob):
- every `session_state_*.md`
- every `compact_checkpoint.md`

Exclude anything under an `archive/` subfolder.

## Step 2 — Extract only the essentials from each

Use **targeted extraction** (grep/sed for the frontmatter and the relevant
section lines) — **not** full-file Reads. With dozens of files across many
projects, reading each in full would blow your context. Pull only:
- **Project** — a readable name derived from the folder (the last meaningful
  segment(s) of the decoded path, e.g. `…-projects-my-app` → "my-app").
- **What** — the topic/description.
- **Next action** — the single next step (from "Next action" / "Immediate" /
  "Current Status").
- **Last touched** — the `created:` date (fall back to file mtime if absent).
- **Type** — session-state vs **⚠ active compact-checkpoint** (a checkpoint means
  a task was mid-flight at a compact and never closed out).

## Step 3 — Present the dashboard

Sort most-recently-touched first. Group into:

**🔵 Active (touched ≤ 14 days)** — table: Project | What | Next action | Last touched
**⚪ Stale (older)** — same columns, condensed; these are candidates to finish or archive.

Surface any **⚠ active checkpoint** at the very top — that's interrupted work.

If the user passed an argument, filter to it (a project name, or `stale` /
`active`).

## Step 4 — Close with a nudge

One line: how many open threads total, and your pick for the single most worth
resuming next (most recent, or most important-but-going-stale). A nudge, not a
lecture.

Keep the whole thing scannable — this is a dashboard, not a report. Read-only;
never modify the state files.
